# The Game

Welcome to The Game repository!
## Description

The Game is an open-source project written in Golang. It starts as an HTTP server that accepts requests. Initially, the objective of the game is to retrieve a winning token from the server. However, with each pull request, the game's mechanics and objectives may change. Hacking the game is not only allowed but expected to win. The project is expected to evolve over time with contributions from the community, potentially expanding into a full-fledged game with a client-side component.
